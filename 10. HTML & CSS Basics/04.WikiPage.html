    <h1>The Brown Bear</h1>
        <p class="Brown Bear Info">The brown bear (Ursus arctos) is a large bear species found across Eurasia and
        North America. In North America, the populations of brown bears are called
        grizzly bears, while the subspecies that inhabits the Kodiak Islands of Alaska
        is known as the Kodiak bear. It is one of the largest living terrestrial
        members of the order Carnivora, rivaled in size only by its closest relative,
        the polar bear (Ursus maritimus), which is much less variable in size and
        slightly bigger on average.</p>
